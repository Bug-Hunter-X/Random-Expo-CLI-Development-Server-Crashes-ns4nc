While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without providing any specific error messages in the console. This would often happen after making seemingly innocuous changes to the codebase, making debugging extremely challenging. The crash would manifest as the Metro bundler process suddenly terminating, leaving the server unresponsive.
