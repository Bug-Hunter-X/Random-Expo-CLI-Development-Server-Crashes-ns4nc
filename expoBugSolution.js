To address the random crashes, implement robust error handling. Wrap potentially problematic code sections in try...catch blocks to prevent unhandled exceptions from bringing down the entire server.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
try {
  // Your code that might cause an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  // Handle the error appropriately, e.g., display a user-friendly message or fallback gracefully.
}
```

If the issue persists, investigate your project's dependencies for potential conflicts. Consider temporarily removing recently added modules to isolate the problematic package. Pay attention to log warnings or any suggestions of compatibility issues during the build process. Memory leaks should also be considered and can be investigated by using tools or by simplifying components or functions.
