# Random Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing any error messages. This makes debugging extremely difficult because there is no clear indication of the root cause.

## Bug Description
The Expo development server will unexpectedly terminate without logging any errors to the console. This often occurs after seemingly minor code changes. The Metro bundler process will simply exit, leaving the developer with no information to troubleshoot the issue. This severely hampers productivity and makes consistent development challenging. 

## Solution
The most likely causes are memory leaks, unhandled exceptions, or incompatibility issues between libraries. Check for large or complex components or functions. Consider using a memory profiler to identify any memory leaks. Also, carefully review any recently added or updated libraries to ensure compatibility.
